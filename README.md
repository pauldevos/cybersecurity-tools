- wireshark - powerfull sniffer which can decode lots of protocols, lots of filters.
- tshark - command line version of wireshark
- dumpcap (part of wireshark) - can only capture traffic and can be used by wireshark / tshark
- tcpdump - limited protocol decoding but available on most *NIX platforms
- ettercap - used for injecting traffic not sniffing

All tools use libpcap (on windows winpcap) for sniffing. Wireshark/tshark /dumpcap can use tcpdump filter syntax as capture filter.

As tcpdump is available on most \*NIX system I usually use tcpdump. Depending on the problem I sometimes use tcpdump to capture traffic and write it to a file, and then later use wireshark to analyze it. If available, I use tshark but if the problem gets more complicated I still like to write the data to a file and then use Wireshark for analysis.
