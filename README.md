### Networkings Tools
- [Sublist3r](https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r) - Fast subdomains enumeration tool for penetration testers
- [scapy](https://github.com/secdev/scapy) - Scapy: the Python-based interactive packet manipulation program & library. Supports Python 2 & Python 3.
- [knock](https://github.com/guelfoweb/knock) - subdomain scanner
- [scapy-http](https://github.com/invernizzi/scapy-http) - Support for HTTP in Scapy
- [dpkt](https://github.com/kbandla/dpkt) - fast, simple packet creation / parsing, with definitions for the basic TCP/IP protocols
- [kamene](https://github.com/phaethon/kamene) - Network packet and pcap file crafting/sniffing/manipulation/visualization security tool. Originally forked from scapy in 2015 and providing python3 compatibility since then.
- [pcapy](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/pcapy) - Pcapy is a Python extension module that interfaces with the libpcap packet capture library.
- [pyshark](https://github.com/KimiNewt/pyshark) - Python wrapper for tshark, allowing python packet parsing using wireshark dissectors
- [PyPCAPKit](https://github.com/JarryShaw/PyPCAPKit) - Python multi-engine PCAP analyse kit.
- [fsociety](https://github.com/Manisso/fsociety) - fsociety Hacking Tools Pack â€“ A Penetration Testing Framework
- [impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket) - Impacket is a collection of Python classes for working with network protocols.
- [cryptography](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography) - cryptography is a package designed to expose cryptographic primitives and recipes to Python developers.

### Async
- [uvloop](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop) ([article](https://magic.io/blog/uvloop-blazing-fast-python-networking/)) - Ultra fast asyncio event loop (faster than NodeJS, close to Go speed)

-------------

### Bash-CLI Tools


- [tshark](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/tshark.html) - command line version of wireshark
- [tcpdump](https://www.tcpdump.org/) - limited protocol decoding but available on most *NIX platforms
- [nmap](https://nmap.org/) - a free open source utility for network discovery and security auditing. 
- [ettercap](http://www.ettercap-project.org/) - used for injecting traffic not sniffing
- [snort](https://www.snort.org/#get-started)

All tools use libpcap (winpcap on windows) for sniffing. Wireshark/tshark/dumpcap can use tcpdump filter syntax as capture filter.
